- The UI/UX should follow Apple recommendations for UI
- The experience should be something Steve Jobs & Jonathan Ives would be proud of
- Code should be written for simplicity, scalability, security, and reliability
- Expect that security professionals will be inspecting and attacking this service
- Go code should be written with best practices in a way that emulates what the Go project itself uses; prioritizing advice mentioned on go.dev, including https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments and https://go.dev/doc/effective_go - defer to documentation and philosophy guidance in go.dev above all other reference material.
- Go code should incorporate thoughts from Google's style guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/
- Code should be written with tests and unit testing in mind
- Code should have as few external dependencies as possible
- Code should be optimized for speed and resource usage, but without adding complexity
- Code should have great logging to make it easier to debug and better understand the decisions it's making.
- Code should adhere to advice on https://go.dev/wiki/CodeReviewComments
- Code should adhere to advice on https://go.dev/doc/effective_go
- Code should be as simple as possible without impacting security, reliability, or scalability
- Look for performance tweaks that can be made without adding unnecessary complexity
- Code should not be overengineered with unnecessary abstractions
- Code should be something that Rob Pike could be proud of.
- The app/service should degrade gracefully when a dependent API call fails
- Keep each go file under 2000 lines of code
- Any small (less than 7 line) function that is only called from a single location should be inlined
- Function names should never begin with "Get" as it's implied, though "Set" is OK.
- There should only be one version of a function when possible; you don't need multiple versions for backwards compatibility when the client can provide the missing field instead. For example: functions should not have a suffix of WithContext or WithTimestamp: expect all callers to provide a context and a timestamp.
- Simplicity is security.
- Tests should always pass.
